# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Files

The code downloads the zip file provided by the course staff in the current working directory, and unzips its contents in the same directory.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `output.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
